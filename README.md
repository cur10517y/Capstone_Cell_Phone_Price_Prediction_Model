# Capstone_Cell_Phone_Price_Prediction_Model
Bob has started his own mobile company and intends to challenge major competitors. However, he lacks the expertise to estimate the prices of the mobile devices his company manufactures. Recognizing the complexity of the competitive mobile phone market, assumptions won't suffice. To address this challenge, he gathers sales data from various mobile phone companies.

Bob aims to discern the relationship between a mobile phone's features (e.g., RAM, internal memory, etc.) and its selling price. Unfortunately, he lacks proficiency in machine learning and seeks your assistance to overcome this obstacle.

In this problem, the goal is not to predict the exact price but to determine a price range that indicates the relative cost of the mobile phone.
